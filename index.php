$string = 'Farming in Rwanda is at the top of EDPRSS II Objectives and SDGs gools for participating in development of country. More than 76% population in RWANDA  hold agricultur as 
their daily activity .
If someone says that Farming take big part in lives of RWandese or is his daily activies he/she is not away of the truth.But From more than 5 years past our farming
continued to face different problems in Rwanda and at the same time on whole continents. Among the problems our country faced are shortage of water, bad season, lack appropriate
transport to feed the cows, catastrophic diseases in cattle, modern way to control health of cattle.
all of these problems leads to shortage of milk production, meat, very bad nutrition to children,make economic to go down as
 instead of increasing.With the smart farming can help us to increase our production and economic of country.
The solution of smart farming will be the one that will solve the problem and  help small holder farmers and farmers in general.
What smart farming will  solve? Smart farming 
bring solution of ensure healthcare of cattles, appropriate feeding cattle, modern milking. The solution will rise the economic
 of country and on continent.

The goal
--------------------------------------------------------
The overall goal of smart farming in Rwanda is to increase food security, stakeholder incomes and contribution to the national economy.
The specific objectives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of smart farming is to improvie the livelihoods of the livestock farmers by enhancing the 
delivery of livestock inputs and services to livestock farmers.Improving healthcare 
of livestock by controlling diseases, providing modern feeding and milking.
what System will do
------------------------------------------------------------------
The System is intellegent and is combination of different components 
, sensor will be around the cattle for sessiong any sensitive information from cattle. For example here in Rwanda many
cows killed by Inkubasi(This diseases caused by increasing of temperature) so we will have sensors for measuring the temperuture. We will have
system for milkng the cattle. This is good because System is reliable and faster that will the market to grow  and develop country econimie.
My system will also ensure how water for cow is smart because It will measure up to 6 parmeters.
such as dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, PH, Conductivity and temperature.The control of concentration of ions like Ammonium(NH4+),Calcium(Ca2+) and so on.
All of these above parmeters example are to ensure the good health of cattle and 
provide the production increasing that leading to livestock farmers development and country economie.
.
How Sytem will work
------------------------------------
.Sensors will detect sensitive information then send to 
LoraWan then take API From lorwan technology the store data into database 
to analyse it , manupilate it  then send to web so that can be viewed on different 
devices.
